Project Description
===================
Charles Nurse created this demonstration as an introduction to two new ways to create modules for DNN version 8 and above: using either an MVC or SPA approach.

He also wrote excellent documentation to accompany this sample code. Thos blogs can be found at:

Currently (in 2019) these will be the most recent 7 blogs from Charles Nurse. These were all published in 2016, but still work well to describe some architectural choices - as well as extensions and options that only some modules may take advantage of.
